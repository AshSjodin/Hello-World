# Hello-World
My first repository.
Hi, I'm Ash. Coding is becoming a great understanding. I'm going through freeCodeCamp.org's certification to start. I'm thankful to Hashlips for introducing a simple artist to coding NFT's, but I had no idea what to do or where to start. I happened to cross by a Youtube talk, How To Become A Developer by John Mosesman and here I am.
